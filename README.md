# Perfume Recommendation Program

This program is a console-based perfume recommendation system that uses **Versace perfumes** as its data source. It was developed as a simplified version of a larger concept aimed at solving a common problem in perfume shopping: the lack of personalization.

## Background

The idea for this project came from a personal experience. For people with scent sensitivities or specific preferences, finding the right perfume, especially online or in stores, can be frustrating and uncomfortable. Thereâ€™s often no clear way to filter perfumes based on what someone truly wants, and exploring options one by one can even cause discomfort or allergic reactions.

## The Problem

Perfume shopping lacks proper guidance and personalization. People are overwhelmed by choices, and there's no reliable tool to help them filter perfumes based on:
- Specific scent notes
- Intensity levels
- Gender preferences
- Scents to avoid
- Mood or occasion
Even users without sensitivities struggle to find scents that match their personal style without knowing a brand or product name in advance.

## The Solution

This program was built as a small-scale version of a larger vision: a smart, personalized perfume guide.

In this version, users can:
- Input scent notes they like or dislike
- Choose intensity or gender preferences
- Get recommendations from a curated list of Versace perfumes

The program then filters and recommends perfumes that align with their input, helping them discover scents that suit them, even without having a specific brand or product in mind.

## Project Scope

While the full vision involves supporting multiple brands and more advanced personalization, this version focuses only on Versace perfumes as a prototype to demonstrate the concept.

## Future Plans

This program is a first step toward building a broader application that can guide users through personalized perfume recommendations across multiple brands and scent types.
